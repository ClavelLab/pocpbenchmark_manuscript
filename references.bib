  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Microbiome research needs comprehensive repositories of cultured bacteria from the intestine of mammalian hosts. We expanded the mouse intestinal bacterial collection (www.dsmz.de/miBC) to 212 strains, all publicly available and taxonomically described. This includes strain-level diversity, small-sized bacteria, and previously undescribed taxa (one family, 10 genera, and 39 species). This collection enabled metagenome-educated prediction of synthetic communities (SYNs) that capture key functional differences between microbiomes, notably identifying communities associated with either resistance or susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Additionally, nine species were used to amend the Oligo-Mouse Microbiota (OMM)12 model, yielding the OMM19.1 model. The added strains compensated for phenotype differences between OMM12 and specific pathogen-free mice, including body composition and immune cells in the intestine and associated lymphoid tissues. Ready-to-use OMM stocks are available for future studies. In conclusion, this work improves our knowledge of gut microbiota diversity in mice and enables functional studies via the modular use of isolates.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We propose an approach to delineate genera that excludes the direct use of the 16S rRNA gene and focuses on a standard genome relatedness index, the average nucleotide identity. Our findings are of importance to the microbiology community because the emergent properties of               Bacteria               and               Archaea               that are identified in this study will help assign genera with higher taxonomic resolution.                        ,              ABSTRACT                            Genus assignment is fundamental in the characterization of microbes, yet there is currently no unambiguous way to demarcate genera solely using standard genomic relatedness indices. Here, we propose an approach to demarcate genera that relies on the combined use of the average nucleotide identity, genome alignment fraction, and the distinction between type- and non-type species. More than 3,500 genomes representing type strains of species from {$>$}850 genera of either bacterial or archaeal lineages were tested. Over 140 genera were analyzed in detail within the taxonomic context of order/family. Significant genomic differences between members of a genus and type species of other genera in the same order/family were conserved in 94\% of the cases. Nearly 90\% (92\% if polyphyletic genera are excluded) of the type strains were classified in agreement with current taxonomy. The 448 type strains that need reclassification directly impact 33\% of the genera analyzed in detail. The results provide a first line of evidence that the combination of genomic indices provides added resolution to effectively demarcate genera within the taxonomic framework that is currently based on the 16S rRNA gene. We also identify the emergence of natural breakpoints at the genome level that can further help in the circumscription of taxa, increasing the proportion of directly impacted genera to at least 43\% and pointing at inaccuracies on the use of the 16S rRNA gene as a taxonomic marker, despite its precision. Altogether, these results suggest that genomic coherence is an emergent property of genera in               Bacteria               and               Archaea               .

  abstract = {The taxonomy of the Listeriaceae family has undergone substantial revisions, expanding the Listeria genus from 6 to 29 species since 2009. However, these classifications have relied on 16S rRNA gene sequences and conventional polyphasic taxonomy, with limited use of genomic approaches. This study aimed to employ genomic tools, including phylogenomics, Overall Genomic Relatedness Indices (OGRIs), and core-genome phylogenomic analyses, to reevaluate the taxonomy of the Listeriaceae family. The analyses involved the construction of phylogenetic and phylogenomic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and core genomes from 34 type strain genomes belonging to Listeriaceae family. OGRIs, which encompass Average Amino acid Identity (AAI), core-proteome AAI (cAAI), and Percentage of Conserved Proteins (POCP), were calculated, and specific threshold values of 70\%, 87\%, and 72–73\% were established, respectively, to delimitate genera in the Listeriaceae family. These newly proposed OGRI thresholds unveiled distinct evolutionary lineages. The outcomes of this taxonomic re-evaluation were: (i): the division of the Listeria genus into an emended Listeria genus regrouping only Listeria senso stricto species; (ii): the remaining Listeria senso lato species were transferred into three newly proposed genera: Murraya gen. nov., Mesolisteria gen. nov., and Paenilisteria gen. nov. within Listeriaceae; (iii): Brochothrix was transferred to the newly proposed family Brochothricaceae fam. nov. within the Caryophanales order; (iiii): Listeria ivanovii subsp. londonensis was elevated to the species level as Listeria londonensis sp. nov.; and (iiiii): Murraya murrayi comb. nov. was reclassified as a later heterotypic synonym of Murraya grayi comb. nov. This taxonomic framework enables more precise identification of pathogenic Listeriaceae species, with significant implications for important areas such as food safety, clinical diagnostics, epidemiology, and public health.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.                                         Results               We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.                                         Conclusion               The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene and whole genome sequencing revealed the strain to represent a member of the family Ruminococcaceae distant from described species and genera. The strain was moderately saccharolytic with mannose as the preferred substrate and produced lactic acid, acetic acid and H2 as the end products. The major cellular long-chain fatty acids were C16 : 0 and C16 : 0 aldehyde. The genomic DNA G+C content was 52.3 mol\%. On the basis of chemotaxonomic and genomic properties it was concluded that the strain represents a novel species in a new genus within the family Ruminococcaceae , for which the name Hydrogeniiclostidium mannosilyticum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

Here, we present an update to GTDB-Tk that uses a divide-and-conquer approach where user genomes are initially placed into a bacterial reference tree with family-level representatives followed by placement into an appropriate class-level subtree comprising species representatives. This substantially reduces the memory requirements of GTDB-Tk while having minimal impact on classification.GTDB-Tk is implemented in Python and licenced under the GNU General Public Licence v3.0.

  abstract = {To evaluate binary classifications and their confusion matrices, scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.},

  abstract = {Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as               R               -squared or               R               2               ) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between               R               2               and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (               R               -squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of               R               -squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.},

The use of 16S rRNA gene sequence data has revolutionized our understanding of the microbial world and led to a rapid increase in the number of descriptions of novel taxa, especially at the species level. It has allowed in many cases for the demarcation of taxa into distinct species, but its limitations in a number of groups have resulted in the continued use of DNA–DNA hybridization. As technology has improved, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided a rapid and cost-effective approach to obtaining whole-genome sequences of microbial strains. Although some 12{$\mkern1mu$}000 bacterial or archaeal genome sequences are available for comparison, only 1725 of these are of actual type strains, limiting the use of genomic data in comparative taxonomic studies when there are nearly 11{$\mkern1mu$}000 type strains. Efforts to obtain complete genome sequences of all type strains are critical to the future of microbial systematics. The incorporation of genomics into the taxonomy and systematics of the Bacteria and Archaea coupled with computational advances will boost the credibility of taxonomy in the genomic era.

  abstract = {A novel acidophilic member of the phylum Actinobacteria was isolated from an acidic, metal-contaminated stream draining from an abandoned underground coal mine (Trongol mine), situated close to Curanilahue, Biobío Region, Chile. The isolate (USS-CCA1T) was demonstrated to be a heterotroph that catalysed under aerobic conditions the oxidation of ferrous iron and the reduction of ferric iron under anaerobic conditions, but not the oxidation of sulfur nor hydrogen. USS-CCA1T is a Gram-positive, motile, short rod-shaped, mesophilic bacterium with a temperature growth optimum at 30 °C (range 20–39 °C). It was categorized as an extreme acidophile growing between 1.7 and 4.5 and optimally at pH 3.0. The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA of the isolate was 74.1 mol\%, which is highly related to Aciditerrimonas ferrireducens IC-180T , (the most closely related genus; 94.4 \% 16S rRNA gene identity), and higher than other acidophilic actinobacteria. The isolate (USS-CCA1T) was shown to form a distinct 16S rRNA clade from characterized acidophilic actinobacteria, well separated from the genera Acidimicrobium , Ferrimicrobium , Ferrithrix , ‘Acidithrix’ and Aciditerrimonas . Genomic indexes (ANIb, DDH, AAI, POCP) derived from the USS-CCA1T draft genome sequence (deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession WJHE00000000) support assignment of the isolate to a new species and a new genus within the Acidimicrobiaceae family. Isolate USS-CCA1T is the designated type strain of the novel species Acidiferrimicrobium australe (=DSM 106828T,=RGM 2506T).},

Assemblies are now more stringently evaluated for contamination and for completeness of annotation prior to acceptance into RefSeq. MAGs now account for over 17000 assemblies in RefSeq, split over 165 orders and 362 families. Changes in the Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP), which is used to annotate nearly all RefSeq assemblies include better detection of protein-coding genes. Nearly 83\% of RefSeq proteins are now named by a curated Protein Family Model, a 4.7\% increase in the past three years ago. In addition to literature citations, Enzyme Commission numbers, and gene symbols, Gene Ontology terms are now assigned to 48\% of RefSeq proteins, allowing for easier multi-genome comparison.

  abstract = {Finding orthologs remains an important bottleneck in comparative genomics analyses. While the authors of software for the quick comparison of protein sequences evaluate the speed of their software and compare their results against the most usual software for the task, it is not common for them to evaluate their software for more particular uses, such as finding orthologs as reciprocal best hits (RBH). Here we compared RBH results obtained using software that runs faster than blastp. Namely, lastal, diamond, and MMseqs2. We found that lastal required the least time to produce results. However, it yielded fewer results than any other program when comparing the proteins encoded by evolutionarily distant genomes. The program producing the most similar number of RBH to blastp was diamond ran with the “ultra-sensitive” option. However, this option was diamond’s slowest, with the “very-sensitive” option offering the best balance between speed and RBH results. The speeding up of the programs was much more evident when dealing with eukaryotic genomes, which code for more numerous proteins. For example, lastal took a median of approx. 1.5\% of the blastp time to run with bacterial proteomes and 0.6\% with eukaryotic ones, while diamond with the very-sensitive option took 7.4\% and 5.2\%, respectively. Though estimated error rates were very similar among the RBH obtained with all programs, RBH obtained with MMseqs2 had the lowest error rates among the programs tested. The fast algorithms for pairwise protein comparison produced results very similar to blast in a fraction of the time, with diamond offering the best compromise in speed, sensitivity and quality, as long as a sensitivity option, other than the default, was chosen.},

  abstract = {Abstract The study of microbial communities is hampered by the large fraction of still unknown bacteria. However, many of these species have been isolated, yet lack a validly published name or description. The validation of names for novel bacteria requires that the uniqueness of those taxa is demonstrated and their properties are described. The accepted format for this is the protologue, which can be time-consuming to create. Hence, many research fields in microbiology and biotechnology will greatly benefit from new approaches that reduce the workload and harmonise the generation of protologues. We have developed Protologger, a bioinformatic tool that automatically generates all the necessary readouts for writing a detailed protologue. By producing multiple taxonomic outputs, functional features and ecological analysis using the 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences from a single species, the time needed to gather the information for describing novel taxa is substantially reduced. The usefulness of Protologger was demonstrated by using three published isolate collections to describe 34 novel taxa, encompassing 17 novel species and 17 novel genera, including the automatic generation of ecologically and functionally relevant names. We also highlight the need to utilise multiple taxonomic delineation methods, as while inconsistencies between each method occur, a combined approach provides robust placement. Protologger is open source; all scripts and datasets are available, along with a webserver at www.protologger.de},

  abstract = {Numerous bacteria in the human gut microbiome remains unknown and/or have yet to be cultured. While collections of human gut bacteria have been published, none are publicly accessible. This is partly due to issues with the deposition of strains to public culture collections. We address these key issues (microbial unknowns, lack of public access to isolates) by proposing a framework that facilitates large-scale submission of isolates, exemplified by a rich collection of human gut isolates that is taxonomically described, functionally novel, and made publicly available. An innovative bulk strain submission system was established by large-scale generation and curation of persistent strain identifiers (https://straininfo.dsmz.de). This was used to create the Human intestinal Bacterial Collection (www.hibc.rwth-aachen.de), which contains 340 strains representing 198 species within 29 families and 7 phyla, of which 32 previously unknown taxa are taxonomically described and named. These included three butyrate- producing species of Faecalibacterium and new dominant species associated with health and inflammatory bowel disease. Plasmids were identified to be prolific within the HiBC isolates, with almost half (46\%) of strains containing one or more plasmids (up to 6). Megaplasmids were identified within two strains, one of them is globally present within multiple Bacteroidales species. The strain submission framework and public collection of easily searchable and available gut bacterial isolates presented here will facilitate the work of many by enabling functional studies.},

However, there is resistance to adopting a single framework to preserve taxonomic freedom, and ever increasing numbers of genomes derived from uncultured prokaryotes threaten to overwhelm current nomenclatural practices, which are based on characterised isolates. The challenge ahead then is to reach a consensus on the taxonomic framework and to adapt and scale the existing nomenclatural code, or create a new code, to systematically incorporate uncultured taxa into the chosen framework.},

FastANI is accurate for both finished and draft genomes, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to alignment-based approaches. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal clear genetic discontinuity, with 99.8\% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed conforming to {$>$}95\% intra-species and {$<$}83\% inter-species ANI values. This discontinuity is manifested with or without the most frequently sequenced species, and is robust to historic additions in the genome databases.},

  abstract = {The ranks higher than the species in the prokaryotic taxonomy are primarily designated based on phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, but no definite standards exist for the absolute relatedness (measured by 16S rRNA or other means) between the ranks. Accordingly, it remains unknown how comparable the ranks are between different organisms. To gain insights into this question, we studied the relationship between shared gene content and genetic relatedness for 175 fully sequenced strains, using as a robust measure of relatedness the average amino acid identity (AAI) of the shared genes. Our results reveal that adjacent ranks (e.g., phylum versus class) frequently show extensive overlap in terms of genetic and gene content relatedness of the grouped organisms, and hence, the current system is of limited predictive power in this respect. The overlap between nonadjacent ranks (e.g., phylum versus family) is generally limited and attributable to clear inconsistencies of the taxonomy. In addition to providing means for standardizing taxonomy, our AAI-based approach provides a means to evaluate the robustness of alternative genetic markers for phylogenetic purposes. For instance, the 23S rRNA gene was found to be as good a marker as the 16S rRNA gene, while several of the widely distributed protein-coding genes, such as the RNA polymerase and gyrase subunits, show a strong phylogenetic signal, albeit less strong than the rRNA genes (0.78 {$>$} R2 {$>$} 0.69 for the protein-coding genes versus R2 = 0.84 for the rRNA genes). The AAI approach outlined here could contribute significantly to a genome-based taxonomy for all microbial organisms.}

Most named genera in this family are delineated based on genomic relatedness and phylogenetic relationships, but some historically named genera show inconsistent distribution and phylogenetic breadth. The most problematic is \&\#160;\&\#160;Rhizobium\&\#160;\&\#160;, which is notorious for being highly paraphyletic, as most newly described species in the family are assigned to this genus without consideration of their proximity to existing genera, or the need to create novel genera. Moreover, many \&\#160;\&\#160;Rhizobiaceae\&\#160;\&\#160; genera lack synapomorphic traits that would give them biological and ecological significance. We propose a common framework for genus delimitation within the family \&\#160;\&\#160;Rhizobiaceae\&\#160;\&\#160;, wherein genera are defined as monophyletic groups in a core-genome gene phylogeny, that are separated from related species using a pairwise core-proteome average amino acid identity (cpAAI) threshold of approximately 86{$\mkern1mu\%$}. We further propose that additional genomic or phenotypic evidence can justify division of species into separate genera even if they share greater than 86{$\mkern1mu\%$} cpAAI. Applying this framework, we propose to reclassify \&\#160;\&\#160;Rhizobium rhizosphaerae\&\#160;\&\#160; and \&\#160;\&\#160;Rhizobium oryzae\&\#160;\&\#160; into Xaviernesmea gen. nov.

Lastly, we present arguments that the unification of the genera \&\#160;\&\#160;Ensifer\&\#160;\&\#160; and \&\#160;\&\#160;Sinorhizobium\&\#160;\&\#160; in Opinion 84 of the Judicial Commission is no longer justified by current genomic and phenotypic data.

We therefore propose emended descriptions of \&\#160;\&\#160;Ensifer\&\#160;\&\#160; and \&\#160;\&\#160;Sinorhizobium\&\#160;\&\#160;, which we argue should be considered as separate genera.}

  abstract = {Advances in high-throughput sequencing in the first decade of the 21st century kicked off studies on host-associated microbial communities (the microbiota) using culture-independent approaches. By providing detailed insights into the microbiota composition, this methodology launched a new discipline focused on exploring the human microbiome during health and disease (1). Microbiome research touches many aspects of human health since changes in the fecal microbiota composition suggest that a microbiome imbalance (dysbiosis) is associated with major causes of morbidity and mortality (2), ranging from cardiovascular disease (3) to colorectal cancer (4, 5), diabetes (6), chronic kidney disease (7), chronic liver disease (8), and even neurological disorders(9) (Fig. 1). Changes in the fecal microbiota are relevant because they reflect alterations in the composition of the colonic microbiota, which is by far the largest community inhabiting our body (10) and an important source of microbial metabolites that affect human health (11). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that maintain gut homeostasis and the ecological causes for its disruption during gut dysbiosis is essential to answer central questions in human microbiome research.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               In gut microbiome studies, the cultured gut microbial resource plays essential roles, such as helping to unravel gut microbial functions and host-microbe interactions. Although several major studies have been performed to elucidate the cultured human gut microbiota, up to 70\% of the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome species have not been cultured to date. Large-scale gut microbial isolation and identification as well as availability to the public are imperative for gut microbial studies and further characterizing human gut microbial functions.                                         Results                                In this study, we constructed a human Gut Microbial Biobank (hGMB; homepage:                 hgmb.nmdc.cn                 ) through the cultivation of 10,558 isolates from 31 sample mixtures of 239 fresh fecal samples from healthy Chinese volunteers, and deposited 1170 strains representing 400 different species in culture collections of the International Depository Authority for long-term preservation and public access worldwide. Following the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes, 102 new species were characterized and denominated, while 28 new genera and 3 new families were proposed. hGMB represented over 80\% of the common and dominant human gut microbial genera and species characterized from global human gut 16S rRNA gene amplicon data (                 n                 = 11,647) and cultured 24 “most-wanted” and “medium priority” taxa proposed by the Human Microbiome Project. We in total sequenced 115 genomes representing 102 novel taxa and 13 previously known species. Further in silico analysis revealed that the newly sequenced hGMB genomes represented 22 previously uncultured species in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) and contributed 24 representatives of potentially “dark taxa” that had not been discovered by UHGG. The nonredundant gene catalogs generated from the hGMB genomes covered over 50\% of the functionally known genes (KEGG orthologs) in the largest global human gut gene catalogs and approximately 10\% of the “most wanted” functionally unknown proteins in the FUnkFams database.                                                        Conclusions               A publicly accessible human Gut Microbial Biobank (hGMB) was established that contained 1170 strains and represents 400 human gut microbial species. hGMB expands the gut microbial resources and genomic repository by adding 102 novel species, 28 new genera, 3 new families, and 115 new genomes of human gut microbes.},

Compared to plants and animals, fungi have simple body plans with often morphologically and ecologically obscure structures. This poses challenges for accurate and precise identifications. Here we provide a conceptual framework for the identification of fungi, encouraging the approach of integrative (polyphasic) taxonomy for species delimitation, i.e. the combination of genealogy (phylogeny), phenotype (including autecology), and reproductive biology (when feasible). This allows objective evaluation of diagnostic characters, either phenotypic or molecular or both. Verification of identifications is crucial but often neglected. Because of clade-specific evolutionary histories, there is currently no single tool for the identification of fungi, although DNA barcoding using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) remains a first diagnosis, particularly in metabarcoding studies. Secondary DNA barcodes are increasingly implemented for groups where ITS does not provide sufficient precision. Issues of pairwise sequence similarity-based identifications and OTU clustering are discussed, and multiple sequence alignment-based phylogenetic approaches with subsequent verification are recommended as more accurate alternatives. In metabarcoding approaches, the trade-off between speed and accuracy and precision of molecular identifications must be carefully considered. Intragenomic variation of the ITS and other barcoding markers should be properly documented, as phylotype diversity is not necessarily a proxy of species richness. Important strategies to improve molecular identification of fungi are: (1) broadly document intraspecific and intragenomic variation of barcoding markers; (2) substantially expand sequence repositories, focusing on undersampled clades and missing taxa; (3) improve curation of sequence labels in primary repositories and substantially increase the number of sequences based on verified material; (4) link sequence data to digital information of voucher specimens including imagery. In parallel, technological improvements to genome sequencing offer promising alternatives to DNA barcoding in the future. Despite the prevalence of DNA-based fungal taxonomy, phenotype-based approaches remain an important strategy to catalog the global diversity of fungi and establish initial species hypotheses.},

Here, we use the Genome UNClutterer (GUNC) software to identify putatively contaminated genomes in GTDB release 07-RS207. We found that GUNC reported 35,723 genomes as putatively contaminated, comprising 11.25{$\mkern1mu\%$} of the 317,542 genomes in GTDB release 07-RS207. To assess the impact of this high level of inferred contamination on the delineation of taxa, we created ‘clean’ versions of the 34,846 putatively contaminated bacterial genomes by removing the most contaminated half. For each clean half, we re-calculated the ANI and concatenated gene phylogeny and found that only 77 (0.22{$\mkern1mu\%$}) of the genomes were not consistent with their original classification. We conclude that the delineation of taxa in GTDB is robust to the putative contamination detected by GUNC.}

  abstract = {The order Methylococcales constitutes the methanotrophs - bacteria that can metabolize methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as their sole source of energy. These bacteria are significant players in the global carbon cycle and can produce value-added products from methane, such as biopolymers, biofuels, and single-cell proteins for animal feed, among others. Previous studies using single-gene phylogenies have shown inconsistencies in the currently established taxonomic structure of this group. This study aimed to determine and resolve these issues by using whole-genome sequence analyses. Phylogenomic analysis and the use of similarity indexes for genomic comparisons - average amino acid identity, digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), and average nucleotide identity (ANI) - were performed on 91 Methylococcales genomes. Results suggest the reclassification of members at the genus and species levels. Firstly, to resolve polyphyly of the genus Methylomicrobium, Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum, "Methylomicrobium buryatense," Methylomicrobium japanense, Methylomicrobium kenyense, and Methylomicrobium pelagicum are reclassified to a newly proposed genus, Methylotuvimicrobium gen. nov.; they are therefore renamed to Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum comb. nov., "Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense" comb. nov., Methylotuvimicrobium japanense comb. nov., Methylotuvimicrobium kenyense comb. nov., and Methylotuvimicrobium pelagicum comb. nov., respectively. Secondly, due to the phylogenetic affinity and phenotypic similarities of Methylosarcina lacus with Methylomicrobium agile and Methylomicrobium album, the reclassification of the former species to Methylomicrobium lacus comb. nov. is proposed. Thirdly, using established same-species delineation thresholds (70\% dDDH and 95\% ANI), Methylobacter whittenburyi is proposed to be a later heterotypic synonym of Methylobacter marinus (89\% dDDH and 99\% ANI). Also, the effectively but not validly published "Methylomonas denitrificans" was identified as Methylomonas methanica (92\% dDDH and 100\% ANI), indicating that the former is a later heterotypic synonym of the latter. Lastly, strains MC09, R-45363, and R-45371, currently identified as M. methanica, each represent a putative novel species of the genus Methylomonas (21-35\% dDDH and 74-88\% ANI against M. methanica) and were reclassified as Methylomonas sp. strains. It is imperative to resolve taxonomic inconsistencies within this group, first and foremost, to avoid confusion with ecological and evolutionary interpretations in subsequent studies.},

Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the GTDB are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the GTDB.

However, the contribution of the genome sequence to prokaryotic genus delimitation has been less studied. To gain insights into genus definition for the prokaryotes, we attempted to reveal the genus-level genomic differences in the current prokaryotic classification system and to delineate the boundary of a genus on the basis of genomic information. The average nucleotide sequence identity between two genomes can be used for prokaryotic species delineation, but it is not suitable for genus demarcation. We used the percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) between two strains to estimate their evolutionary and phenotypic distance. A comprehensive genomic survey indicated that the POCP can serve as a robust genomic index for establishing the genus boundary for prokaryotic groups. Basically, two species belonging to the same genus would share at least half of their proteins. In a specific lineage, the genus and family/order ranks showed slight or no overlap in terms of POCP values. A prokaryotic genus can be defined as a group of species with all pairwise POCP values higher than 50\%. Integration of whole-genome data into the current taxonomy system can provide comprehensive information for prokaryotic genus definition and delimitation.},

  abstract = {The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy includes organism names and classifications for every sequence in the nucleotide and protein sequence databases of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. Since the last review of this resource in 2012, it has undergone several improvements. Most notable is the shift from a single SQL database to a series of linked databases tied to a framework of data called NameBank. This means that relations among data elements can be adjusted in more detail, resulting in expanded annotation of synonyms, the ability to flag names with specific nomenclatural properties, enhanced tracking of publications tied to names and improved annotation of scientific authorities and types. Additionally, practices utilized by NCBI Taxonomy curators specific to major taxonomic groups are described, terms peculiar to NCBI Taxonomy are explained, external resources are acknowledged and updates to tools and other resources are documented.Database URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy}

  abstract = {Similarity search is one of the most fundamental computations that are regularly performed on ever-increasing protein datasets. Scalability is of paramount importance for uncovering novel phenomena that occur at very large scales. We unleash the power of over 20,000 GPUs on the Summit system to perform all-vs-all protein similarity search on one of the largest publicly available datasets with 405 million proteins, in less than 3.5 hours, cutting the time-to-solution for many use cases from weeks. The variability of protein sequence lengths, as well as the sparsity of the space of pairwise comparisons, make this a challenging problem in distributed memory. Due to the need to construct and maintain a data structure holding indices to all other sequences, this application has a huge memory footprint that makes it hard to scale the problem sizes. We overcome this memory limitation by innovative matrix-based blocking techniques, without introducing additional load imbalance.},

  abstract = {Cable bacteria of the Desulfobulbaceae family are centimeter-long filamentous bacteria, which are capable of conducting long-distance electron transfer. Currently, all cable bacteria are classified into two candidate genera: Candidatus Electronema, typically found in freshwater environments, and Candidatus Electrothrix, typically found in saltwater environments. This taxonomic framework is based on both 16S rRNA gene sequences and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) phylogenies. However, most of the currently available MAGs are highly fragmented, incomplete, and thus likely miss key genes essential for deciphering the physiology of cable bacteria. Also, a closed, circular genome of cable bacteria has not been published yet. To address this, we performed Nanopore long-read and Illumina short-read shotgun sequencing of selected environmental samples and a single-strain enrichment of Ca. Electronema aureum. We recovered multiple cable bacteria MAGs, including two circular and one single-contig. Phylogenomic analysis, also confirmed by 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny, classified one circular MAG and the single-contig MAG as novel species of cable bacteria, which we propose to name Ca. Electronema halotolerans and Ca. Electrothrix laxa, respectively. The Ca. Electronema halotolerans, despite belonging to the previously recognized freshwater genus of cable bacteria, was retrieved from brackish-water sediment. Metabolic predictions showed several adaptations to a high salinity environment, similar to the “saltwater” Ca. Electrothrix species, indicating how Ca. Electronema halotolerans may be the evolutionary link between marine and freshwater cable bacteria lineages.}

We conclude that significant changes in author habits are needed and make constructive suggestions as to how author practice should adapt.},

  abstract = {As the number of environmental small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene sequences has greatly surpassed the number of cultured microorganisms, reconciliation of the established taxonomy and classification of the uncultured microorganisms are crucial.Rational taxonomic boundaries have been proposed for the high taxa (that is, genus and above) of the Bacteria and the Archaea on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence identities. These are : 94.5\% for genus, 86.5\% for family, 82.0\% for order, 78.5\% for class and 75.0\% for phylum.The application of these thresholds to the clustering of the SILVA database confirms that the current number of formally described taxa at any rank (for example, ∼30 phyla) is negligible compared with the total number of detected taxa (for example, ∼1,300 phyla).In addition, the study of the annual rate of taxa discovery enables a new extrapolation of the total number of species (4 × 105) and high taxa on Earth (for example, 1 × 105 genera), which indicates that most common terrestrial and aquatic habitats will be exhaustively described within the next 5 years.Taxon recovery tests that were carried out using partial 16S rRNA gene sequences show that short reads are not suitable for accurate richness estimations and accurate classifications of high taxa.On the basis of the general taxonomic thresholds and phylogenetic considerations, we suggest a new biodiversity unit known as the candidate taxonomic unit (CTU), which is compatible with the hierarchy that was established in the Bacteriological Code. The ability to specify a taxonomic rank for particular clades is a major advance in understanding tree topologies and goes beyond the classic phylogenetic delineation.The usefulness of CTUs has been intensively tested in the reclassification of the phylum Spirochaetes and the classification of 15 candidate divisions and environmental clades that are presented in this Analysis article, which also provide new insights into the coherence of classes, phyla and superphyla.By providing explicit and well-documented guidelines, it is hoped that this work will facilitate the implementation of the many changes in the current taxonomy that are necessary to develop a common taxonomic classification of high taxa of bacteria and archaea on the basis of SSU rRNA gene sequences.},
