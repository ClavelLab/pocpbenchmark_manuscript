  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Microbiome research needs comprehensive repositories of cultured bacteria from the intestine of mammalian hosts. We expanded the mouse intestinal bacterial collection (www.dsmz.de/miBC) to 212 strains, all publicly available and taxonomically described. This includes strain-level diversity, small-sized bacteria, and previously undescribed taxa (one family, 10 genera, and 39 species). This collection enabled metagenome-educated prediction of synthetic communities (SYNs) that capture key functional differences between microbiomes, notably identifying communities associated with either resistance or susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Additionally, nine species were used to amend the Oligo-Mouse Microbiota (OMM)12 model, yielding the OMM19.1 model. The added strains compensated for phenotype differences between OMM12 and specific pathogen-free mice, including body composition and immune cells in the intestine and associated lymphoid tissues. Ready-to-use OMM stocks are available for future studies. In conclusion, this work improves our knowledge of gut microbiota diversity in mice and enables functional studies via the modular use of isolates.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In recent decades, the taxonomy of               Bacteria               and               Archaea               , and therefore genus designation, has been largely based on the use of a single ribosomal gene, the 16S rRNA gene, as a taxonomic marker. We propose an approach to delineate genera that excludes the direct use of the 16S rRNA gene and focuses on a standard genome relatedness index, the average nucleotide identity. Our findings are of importance to the microbiology community because the emergent properties of               Bacteria               and               Archaea               that are identified in this study will help assign genera with higher taxonomic resolution.                        ,              ABSTRACT                            Genus assignment is fundamental in the characterization of microbes, yet there is currently no unambiguous way to demarcate genera solely using standard genomic relatedness indices. Here, we propose an approach to demarcate genera that relies on the combined use of the average nucleotide identity, genome alignment fraction, and the distinction between type- and non-type species. More than 3,500 genomes representing type strains of species from {$>$}850 genera of either bacterial or archaeal lineages were tested. Over 140 genera were analyzed in detail within the taxonomic context of order/family. Significant genomic differences between members of a genus and type species of other genera in the same order/family were conserved in 94\% of the cases. Nearly 90\% (92\% if polyphyletic genera are excluded) of the type strains were classified in agreement with current taxonomy. The 448 type strains that need reclassification directly impact 33\% of the genera analyzed in detail. The results provide a first line of evidence that the combination of genomic indices provides added resolution to effectively demarcate genera within the taxonomic framework that is currently based on the 16S rRNA gene. We also identify the emergence of natural breakpoints at the genome level that can further help in the circumscription of taxa, increasing the proportion of directly impacted genera to at least 43\% and pointing at inaccuracies on the use of the 16S rRNA gene as a taxonomic marker, despite its precision. Altogether, these results suggest that genomic coherence is an emergent property of genera in               Bacteria               and               Archaea               .

  abstract = {The taxonomy of the Listeriaceae family has undergone substantial revisions, expanding the Listeria genus from 6 to 29 species since 2009. However, these classifications have relied on 16S rRNA gene sequences and conventional polyphasic taxonomy, with limited use of genomic approaches. This study aimed to employ genomic tools, including phylogenomics, Overall Genomic Relatedness Indices (OGRIs), and core-genome phylogenomic analyses, to reevaluate the taxonomy of the Listeriaceae family. The analyses involved the construction of phylogenetic and phylogenomic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and core genomes from 34 type strain genomes belonging to Listeriaceae family. OGRIs, which encompass Average Amino acid Identity (AAI), core-proteome AAI (cAAI), and Percentage of Conserved Proteins (POCP), were calculated, and specific threshold values of 70\%, 87\%, and 72–73\% were established, respectively, to delimitate genera in the Listeriaceae family. These newly proposed OGRI thresholds unveiled distinct evolutionary lineages. The outcomes of this taxonomic re-evaluation were: (i): the division of the Listeria genus into an emended Listeria genus regrouping only Listeria senso stricto species; (ii): the remaining Listeria senso lato species were transferred into three newly proposed genera: Murraya gen. nov., Mesolisteria gen. nov., and Paenilisteria gen. nov. within Listeriaceae; (iii): Brochothrix was transferred to the newly proposed family Brochothricaceae fam. nov. within the Caryophanales order; (iiii): Listeria ivanovii subsp. londonensis was elevated to the species level as Listeria londonensis sp. nov.; and (iiiii): Murraya murrayi comb. nov. was reclassified as a later heterotypic synonym of Murraya grayi comb. nov. This taxonomic framework enables more precise identification of pathogenic Listeriaceae species, with significant implications for important areas such as food safety, clinical diagnostics, epidemiology, and public health.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.                                         Results               We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.                                         Conclusion               The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences.

The strain was moderately saccharolytic with mannose as the preferred substrate and produced lactic acid, acetic acid and H2 as the end products. The major cellular long-chain fatty acids were C16 : 0 and C16 : 0 aldehyde. The genomic DNA G+C content was 52.3 mol\%. On the basis of chemotaxonomic and genomic properties it was concluded that the strain represents a novel species in a new genus within the family Ruminococcaceae , for which the name Hydrogeniiclostidium mannosilyticum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

  abstract = {To evaluate binary classifications and their confusion matrices, scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.},

  abstract = {Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as               R               -squared or               R               2               ) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between               R               2               and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (               R               -squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of               R               -squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.},

The isolate (USS-CCA1T) was demonstrated to be a heterotroph that catalysed under aerobic conditions the oxidation of ferrous iron and the reduction of ferric iron under anaerobic conditions, but not the oxidation of sulfur nor hydrogen. USS-CCA1T is a Gram-positive, motile, short rod-shaped, mesophilic bacterium with a temperature growth optimum at 30 °C (range 20–39 °C). It was categorized as an extreme acidophile growing between 1.7 and 4.5 and optimally at pH 3.0. The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA of the isolate was 74.1 mol\%, which is highly related to Aciditerrimonas ferrireducens IC-180T , (the most closely related genus; 94.4 \% 16S rRNA gene identity), and higher than other acidophilic actinobacteria. The isolate (USS-CCA1T) was shown to form a distinct 16S rRNA clade from characterized acidophilic actinobacteria, well separated from the genera Acidimicrobium , Ferrimicrobium , Ferrithrix , ‘Acidithrix’ and Aciditerrimonas . Genomic indexes (ANIb, DDH, AAI, POCP) derived from the USS-CCA1T draft genome sequence (deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession WJHE00000000) support assignment of the isolate to a new species and a new genus within the Acidimicrobiaceae family.

  abstract = {The Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) contains over 315~000 bacterial and archaeal genomes and 236 million proteins with up-to-date and consistent annotation. In the past 3 years, we have expanded the diversity of the RefSeq collection by including the best quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) submitted to INSDC (DDBJ, ENA and GenBank), while maintaining its quality by adding validation checks. Assemblies are now more stringently evaluated for contamination and for completeness of annotation prior to acceptance into RefSeq. MAGs now account for over 17000 assemblies in RefSeq, split over 165 orders and 362 families. Changes in the Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP), which is used to annotate nearly all RefSeq assemblies include better detection of protein-coding genes. Nearly 83\% of RefSeq proteins are now named by a curated Protein Family Model, a 4.7\% increase in the past three years ago. In addition to literature citations, Enzyme Commission numbers, and gene symbols, Gene Ontology terms are now assigned to 48\% of RefSeq proteins, allowing for easier multi-genome comparison. RefSeq is found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/. PGAP is available as a stand-alone tool able to produce GenBank-ready files at https://github.com/ncbi/pgap.},

  abstract = {Finding orthologs remains an important bottleneck in comparative genomics analyses. While the authors of software for the quick comparison of protein sequences evaluate the speed of their software and compare their results against the most usual software for the task, it is not common for them to evaluate their software for more particular uses, such as finding orthologs as reciprocal best hits (RBH). Here we compared RBH results obtained using software that runs faster than blastp. Namely, lastal, diamond, and MMseqs2. We found that lastal required the least time to produce results. However, it yielded fewer results than any other program when comparing the proteins encoded by evolutionarily distant genomes. The program producing the most similar number of RBH to blastp was diamond ran with the “ultra-sensitive” option. However, this option was diamond’s slowest, with the “very-sensitive” option offering the best balance between speed and RBH results. The speeding up of the programs was much more evident when dealing with eukaryotic genomes, which code for more numerous proteins. For example, lastal took a median of approx. 1.5\% of the blastp time to run with bacterial proteomes and 0.6\% with eukaryotic ones, while diamond with the very-sensitive option took 7.4\% and 5.2\%, respectively. Though estimated error rates were very similar among the RBH obtained with all programs, RBH obtained with MMseqs2 had the lowest error rates among the programs tested. The fast algorithms for pairwise protein comparison produced results very similar to blast in a fraction of the time, with diamond offering the best compromise in speed, sensitivity and quality, as long as a sensitivity option, other than the default, was chosen.},

  abstract = {Abstract The study of microbial communities is hampered by the large fraction of still unknown bacteria. However, many of these species have been isolated, yet lack a validly published name or description. The validation of names for novel bacteria requires that the uniqueness of those taxa is demonstrated and their properties are described. The accepted format for this is the protologue, which can be time-consuming to create. Hence, many research fields in microbiology and biotechnology will greatly benefit from new approaches that reduce the workload and harmonise the generation of protologues. We have developed Protologger, a bioinformatic tool that automatically generates all the necessary readouts for writing a detailed protologue. By producing multiple taxonomic outputs, functional features and ecological analysis using the 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences from a single species, the time needed to gather the information for describing novel taxa is substantially reduced. The usefulness of Protologger was demonstrated by using three published isolate collections to describe 34 novel taxa, encompassing 17 novel species and 17 novel genera, including the automatic generation of ecologically and functionally relevant names. We also highlight the need to utilise multiple taxonomic delineation methods, as while inconsistencies between each method occur, a combined approach provides robust placement. Protologger is open source; all scripts and datasets are available, along with a webserver at www.protologger.de},

  abstract = {Numerous bacteria in the human gut microbiome remains unknown and/or have yet to be cultured. While collections of human gut bacteria have been published, none are publicly accessible. This is partly due to issues with the deposition of strains to public culture collections. We address these key issues (microbial unknowns, lack of public access to isolates) by proposing a framework that facilitates large-scale submission of isolates, exemplified by a rich collection of human gut isolates that is taxonomically described, functionally novel, and made publicly available. An innovative bulk strain submission system was established by large-scale generation and curation of persistent strain identifiers (https://straininfo.dsmz.de). This was used to create the Human intestinal Bacterial Collection (www.hibc.rwth-aachen.de), which contains 340 strains representing 198 species within 29 families and 7 phyla, of which 32 previously unknown taxa are taxonomically described and named. These included three butyrate- producing species of Faecalibacterium and new dominant species associated with health and inflammatory bowel disease. Plasmids were identified to be prolific within the HiBC isolates, with almost half (46\%) of strains containing one or more plasmids (up to 6). Megaplasmids were identified within two strains, one of them is globally present within multiple Bacteroidales species. The strain submission framework and public collection of easily searchable and available gut bacterial isolates presented here will facilitate the work of many by enabling functional studies.},

Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) help address this question by facilitating high resolution taxonomic analysis of thousands of genomes from diverse phylogenetic lineages. To scale to available genomes and beyond, we present FastANI, a new method to estimate ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. FastANI is accurate for both finished and draft genomes, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to alignment-based approaches. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal clear genetic discontinuity, with 99.8\% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed conforming to {$>$}95\% intra-species and {$<$}83\% inter-species ANI values. This discontinuity is manifested with or without the most frequently sequenced species, and is robust to historic additions in the genome databases.},

  abstract = {The ranks higher than the species in the prokaryotic taxonomy are primarily designated based on phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, but no definite standards exist for the absolute relatedness (measured by 16S rRNA or other means) between the ranks. Accordingly, it remains unknown how comparable the ranks are between different organisms. To gain insights into this question, we studied the relationship between shared gene content and genetic relatedness for 175 fully sequenced strains, using as a robust measure of relatedness the average amino acid identity (AAI) of the shared genes. Our results reveal that adjacent ranks (e.g., phylum versus class) frequently show extensive overlap in terms of genetic and gene content relatedness of the grouped organisms, and hence, the current system is of limited predictive power in this respect. The overlap between nonadjacent ranks (e.g., phylum versus family) is generally limited and attributable to clear inconsistencies of the taxonomy. In addition to providing means for standardizing taxonomy, our AAI-based approach provides a means to evaluate the robustness of alternative genetic markers for phylogenetic purposes. For instance, the 23S rRNA gene was found to be as good a marker as the 16S rRNA gene, while several of the widely distributed protein-coding genes, such as the RNA polymerase and gyrase subunits, show a strong phylogenetic signal, albeit less strong than the rRNA genes (0.78 {$>$} R2 {$>$} 0.69 for the protein-coding genes versus R2 = 0.84 for the rRNA genes). The AAI approach outlined here could contribute significantly to a genome-based taxonomy for all microbial organisms.},

Most named genera in this family are delineated based on genomic relatedness and phylogenetic relationships, but some historically named genera show inconsistent distribution and phylogenetic breadth. The most problematic is \&\#160;\&\#160;Rhizobium\&\#160;\&\#160;, which is notorious for being highly paraphyletic, as most newly described species in the family are assigned to this genus without consideration of their proximity to existing genera, or the need to create novel genera. Moreover, many \&\#160;\&\#160;Rhizobiaceae\&\#160;\&\#160; genera lack synapomorphic traits that would give them biological and ecological significance. We propose a common framework for genus delimitation within the family \&\#160;\&\#160;Rhizobiaceae\&\#160;\&\#160;, wherein genera are defined as monophyletic groups in a core-genome gene phylogeny, that are separated from related species using a pairwise core-proteome average amino acid identity (cpAAI) threshold of approximately 86{$\mkern1mu\%$}. We further propose that additional genomic or phenotypic evidence can justify division of species into separate genera even if they share greater than 86{$\mkern1mu\%$} cpAAI. Applying this framework, we propose to reclassify \&\#160;\&\#160;Rhizobium rhizosphaerae\&\#160;\&\#160; and \&\#160;\&\#160;Rhizobium oryzae\&\#160;\&\#160; into Xaviernesmea gen. nov.

Lastly, we present arguments that the unification of the genera \&\#160;\&\#160;Ensifer\&\#160;\&\#160; and \&\#160;\&\#160;Sinorhizobium\&\#160;\&\#160; in Opinion 84 of the Judicial Commission is no longer justified by current genomic and phenotypic data.

We therefore propose emended descriptions of \&\#160;\&\#160;Ensifer\&\#160;\&\#160; and \&\#160;\&\#160;Sinorhizobium\&\#160;\&\#160;, which we argue should be considered as separate genera.},

By providing detailed insights into the microbiota composition, this methodology launched a new discipline focused on exploring the human microbiome during health and disease (1). Microbiome research touches many aspects of human health since changes in the fecal microbiota composition suggest that a microbiome imbalance (dysbiosis) is associated with major causes of morbidity and mortality (2), ranging from cardiovascular disease (3) to colorectal cancer (4, 5), diabetes (6), chronic kidney disease (7), chronic liver disease (8), and even neurological disorders(9) (Fig. 1). Changes in the fecal microbiota are relevant because they reflect alterations in the composition of the colonic microbiota, which is by far the largest community inhabiting our body (10) and an important source of microbial metabolites that affect human health (11). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that maintain gut homeostasis and the ecological causes for its disruption during gut dysbiosis is essential to answer central questions in human microbiome research.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               In gut microbiome studies, the cultured gut microbial resource plays essential roles, such as helping to unravel gut microbial functions and host-microbe interactions. Although several major studies have been performed to elucidate the cultured human gut microbiota, up to 70\% of the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome species have not been cultured to date. Large-scale gut microbial isolation and identification as well as availability to the public are imperative for gut microbial studies and further characterizing human gut microbial functions.                                         Results                                In this study, we constructed a human Gut Microbial Biobank (hGMB; homepage:                 hgmb.nmdc.cn                 ) through the cultivation of 10,558 isolates from 31 sample mixtures of 239 fresh fecal samples from healthy Chinese volunteers, and deposited 1170 strains representing 400 different species in culture collections of the International Depository Authority for long-term preservation and public access worldwide. Following the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes, 102 new species were characterized and denominated, while 28 new genera and 3 new families were proposed. hGMB represented over 80\% of the common and dominant human gut microbial genera and species characterized from global human gut 16S rRNA gene amplicon data (                 n                 = 11,647) and cultured 24 “most-wanted” and “medium priority” taxa proposed by the Human Microbiome Project. We in total sequenced 115 genomes representing 102 novel taxa and 13 previously known species. Further in silico analysis revealed that the newly sequenced hGMB genomes represented 22 previously uncultured species in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) and contributed 24 representatives of potentially “dark taxa” that had not been discovered by UHGG. The nonredundant gene catalogs generated from the hGMB genomes covered over 50\% of the functionally known genes (KEGG orthologs) in the largest global human gut gene catalogs and approximately 10\% of the “most wanted” functionally unknown proteins in the FUnkFams database.                                                        Conclusions               A publicly accessible human Gut Microbial Biobank (hGMB) was established that contained 1170 strains and represents 400 human gut microbial species. hGMB expands the gut microbial resources and genomic repository by adding 102 novel species, 28 new genera, 3 new families, and 115 new genomes of human gut microbes.},

Compared to plants and animals, fungi have simple body plans with often morphologically and ecologically obscure structures. This poses challenges for accurate and precise identifications. Here we provide a conceptual framework for the identification of fungi, encouraging the approach of integrative (polyphasic) taxonomy for species delimitation, i.e. the combination of genealogy (phylogeny), phenotype (including autecology), and reproductive biology (when feasible). This allows objective evaluation of diagnostic characters, either phenotypic or molecular or both. Verification of identifications is crucial but often neglected. Because of clade-specific evolutionary histories, there is currently no single tool for the identification of fungi, although DNA barcoding using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) remains a first diagnosis, particularly in metabarcoding studies. Secondary DNA barcodes are increasingly implemented for groups where ITS does not provide sufficient precision. Issues of pairwise sequence similarity-based identifications and OTU clustering are discussed, and multiple sequence alignment-based phylogenetic approaches with subsequent verification are recommended as more accurate alternatives. In metabarcoding approaches, the trade-off between speed and accuracy and precision of molecular identifications must be carefully considered. Intragenomic variation of the ITS and other barcoding markers should be properly documented, as phylotype diversity is not necessarily a proxy of species richness. Important strategies to improve molecular identification of fungi are: (1) broadly document intraspecific and intragenomic variation of barcoding markers; (2) substantially expand sequence repositories, focusing on undersampled clades and missing taxa; (3) improve curation of sequence labels in primary repositories and substantially increase the number of sequences based on verified material; (4) link sequence data to digital information of voucher specimens including imagery. In parallel, technological improvements to genome sequencing offer promising alternatives to DNA barcoding in the future. Despite the prevalence of DNA-based fungal taxonomy, phenotype-based approaches remain an important strategy to catalog the global diversity of fungi and establish initial species hypotheses.},

These genomes are organized into 45 555 bacterial and 2339 archaeal species clusters which is a 200\% increase since the integration of species clusters into the GTDB in June, 2019. Here, we explore prokaryotic diversity from the perspective of the GTDB and highlight the importance of metagenome-assembled genomes in expanding available genomic representation. We also discuss improvements to the GTDB website which allow tracking of taxonomic changes, easy assessment of genome assembly quality, and identification of genomes assembled from type material or used as species representatives. Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the GTDB are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the GTDB. We conclude with a discussion on the use of average nucleotide identities as a pragmatic approach for delineating prokaryotic species.},

However, the contribution of the genome sequence to prokaryotic genus delimitation has been less studied. To gain insights into genus definition for the prokaryotes, we attempted to reveal the genus-level genomic differences in the current prokaryotic classification system and to delineate the boundary of a genus on the basis of genomic information. The average nucleotide sequence identity between two genomes can be used for prokaryotic species delineation, but it is not suitable for genus demarcation. We used the percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) between two strains to estimate their evolutionary and phenotypic distance. A comprehensive genomic survey indicated that the POCP can serve as a robust genomic index for establishing the genus boundary for prokaryotic groups. Basically, two species belonging to the same genus would share at least half of their proteins. In a specific lineage, the genus and family/order ranks showed slight or no overlap in terms of POCP values. A prokaryotic genus can be defined as a group of species with all pairwise POCP values higher than 50\%. Integration of whole-genome data into the current taxonomy system can provide comprehensive information for prokaryotic genus definition and delimitation.},

  abstract = {Reference genomes are essential for metagenomic analyses and functional characterization of the human gut microbiota. We present the Culturable Genome Reference (CGR), a collection of 1,520 nonredundant, high-quality draft genomes generated from {$>$}6,000 bacteria cultivated from fecal samples of healthy humans. Of the 1,520 genomes, which were chosen to cover all major bacterial phyla and genera in the human gut, 264 are not represented in existing reference genome catalogs. We show that this increase in the number of reference bacterial genomes improves the rate of mapping metagenomic sequencing reads from 50\% to {$>$}70\%, enabling higher-resolution descriptions of the human gut microbiome. We use the CGR genomes to annotate functions of 338 bacterial species, showing the utility of this resource for functional studies. We also carry out a pan-genome analysis of 38 important human gut species, which reveals the diversity and specificity of functional enrichment between their core and dispensable genomes.},
